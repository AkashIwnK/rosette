## Applications  

Rosette hosts many domain-specific languages (DSLs) with advanced
programming tools that scale to real-world applications, from
verification of radiotherapy software to synthesis of code for
ultra-low power hardware. Several of these tools have been developed by
first-time users of Rosette in just a few days or weeks.

| [Bagpipe](http://www.konne.me/bagpipe/) | A language for specifying [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) policies and verifying that an Internet Service Providerâ€™s router configurations implement these policies. |
| [Chlorophyll](http://pl.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/chlorophyll/) |  A synthesis-aided programming model and compiler for [GreenArrays GA144](http://www.greenarraychips.com/), a minimalist low-power spatial architecture. | 
| [Neutrons](http://neutrons.uwplse.org) |  A verifier for a subset of [EPICS](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/).  Currently in use at the University of Washington [Clinical Neutron Therapy System](https://staff.washington.edu/jon/cnts/). |
| [Synapse](http://synapse.uwplse.org) |  A framework for specifying and solving optimal synthesis problems. |
| [Wallingford](https://github.com/cdglabs/wallingford) | An experimental constraint reactive programming language. | 
| [More](https://github.com/emina/rosette/tree/master/sdsl) |  Demo languages and tools for [secure stack machines](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2544174.2500574),  data-parallel programing, and web-scraping.  |
