## Applications  

Rosette hosts many domain-specific languages (DSLs) with advanced
programming tools that scale to real-world applications, from
verification of radiotherapy software to synthesis of code for
ultra-low power hardware. Several of these tools have been developed by
first-time users of Rosette in just a few days or weeks.

| [Bagpipe][] | A language for specifying [BGP][] policies and verifying that an Internet Service Providerâ€™s router configurations implement these policies. |
| [Chlorophyll][] |  A synthesis-aided programming model and compiler for [GreenArrays GA144][GA144], a minimalist low-power spatial architecture. |
| [Cosette][] |  A framework for reasoning about SQL equivalences. |
| [Ferrite][] | A framework for specifying and checking file system crash-consistency models. |
| [Greenthumb][] | A framework for constructing superoptimizers. |
| [MemSynth][] | A language and tool for verifying, synthesizing, and disambiguating memory consistency models. |
| [Neutrons][] |  A verifier for a subset of [EPICS][EPICS].  Currently in use at the University of Washington [Clinical Neutron Therapy System][CNTS]. |
| [Nonograms][] | A system for synthesizing problem-solving strategies for logic puzzles. | 
| [Synapse][] |  A framework for specifying and solving optimal synthesis problems. |
| [Ocelot][] | An engine for solving, verifying, and synthesizing specifications in bounded relational logic. |
| [Wallingford][] | An experimental constraint reactive programming language. |
| [More][] |  Demo languages and tools for [secure stack machines][SSM], data-parallel programing, and web-scraping.  |
